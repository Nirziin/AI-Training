# AI-Training

#Project Results and Overview: Summarize the key objectives, results, and insights from your project. Provide context to help viewers understand the motivation and significance of your work.

At the begining, my projet is a translator opensource with AI on images or vid√©os. While it takes a lot of memory to train and I don't have a great computer to do that, I had to reduce at the minimum this project. I will continue this project if I have enough time and the computer for.
The key objectives of this project were : 
  - Using a dataset
  - Training an AI
  - Collecting results

I used google colab to get some VM with GPU and the model YOLOV5 to train my AI. YoloV5 model is a detection model separate in 5 model by the quickest to the more accurate : N, S, M, L, X.

Here is a list of the performance for a 640 pixel image:

(List from the site : https://docs.ultralytics.com/fr/models/yolov5/#performance-metrics ) 

First, I train the AI to analyze and find the letters in a lor of images. My dataset for the training is a dataset opensource on RoboFlow with 1175 images with label:  https://universe.roboflow.com/ann36chen-hbcoz/0603-3/dataset/7
To compare, I used YoloV5 S, M, L and X. Every train with every model was more and more accurate.
